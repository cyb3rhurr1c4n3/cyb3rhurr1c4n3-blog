I’m a cybersecurity student specializing in **Offensive Security**, currently in my third year at the **University of Information Technology** (UIT). I’m passionate about **Red Teaming, Penetration Testing, and Ethical Hacking**.

I continuously sharpen my skills through **CTF competitions, hands-on labs, building my own security tools/scripts and projects**.

My goal is to join a **professional Red Team** where I can push my skills further, contribute to real-world attack simulations, and help organizations strengthen their security posture.

I’m always open to connecting with like-minded security professionals, CTF teams, and mentors. Feel free to reach out — **let’s make this world a safer place together**.
