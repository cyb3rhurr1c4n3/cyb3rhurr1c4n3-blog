Normally, we can simply perform password brute-force with Burp Intruder. However, the server has IP-based rate-limit mechanism, we will be blocked after 1 failed attempt, so we can\u0026rsquo;t brute-force without some tricks (X-Forwarded-For header)\nSolving Process # First, I access the website and see the content inside the password list to have an idea what this challenge is about.\nThe password list has only 20 lines, so I though I can just try every single of them.\nWhen I access the challenge website, I see a login page, so I use the username from the challenge info (ctf-player@picoctf.org) and pair with each password in the list. The result is I got blocked after just 1 failed attempt.\nNow I know the server has some kind of rate-limit mechanism. Based on past experience and a quick Google Search, I guess the server use IP-based rate-limit mechanism because it\u0026rsquo;s one of the most common type and I don\u0026rsquo;t think this medium challenge will use API key rate-limit.\nTherefore, I open Burp, redo these steps above and transfer the /login request to Burp Repeater for some experiments. After that, I do a quick Google search for bypass techniques and the X-Forwarded-For header seems to have potential.\nAfter having the bypass technique, I add the X-Forwarded-For header with a random IP (10.10.10.100) inside the login request and the result shows that I successfully bypass the rate-limit mechanism.\nBefore After Almost done. Now I need to perform password brute-force without being blocked, so I transfer the login request to Burp Intruder tab. There are 2 things need to be iterate: the password field and the IP in X-Forwarded-For header, so that we can bypass the rate-limit mechanism. Therefore, I change the request to this layout:\nI use Pitchfork Attack mode because it can put 2 set of payload into 2 different positions. For the second position (the password field), I paste the password list content in the Payload config tab and see 20 lines, so I need 20 IP from position 1 (the X-Forwarded-For header), I choosed this IP range: 10.10.10.101 - 10.10.10.120\nPassword Field Config X-Forwarded-For Header Config Finally, I start the attack and I found the successful response to get the flag.\nFlag # picoCTF{xff_byp4ss_brut3_6cf524b1} Lessons Learned # The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) header is a de facto HTTP standard used to identify the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through a proxy or load balancer. Because proxies hide the original client IP, this header is crucial for logging, geolocation, and rate limiting. However, it can be manipulated easily by bad actors.\nMitigations # DON\u0026rsquo;T trust client\u0026rsquo;s IP from header: Bad actors can easily manipulate that. Rate-limit mechanism should rely on real IP from TCP connection, or combine with additional authentication like sessions, tokens, keys, CAPTCHA,\u0026hellip;\nIf it\u0026rsquo;s mandatory to use XFF (because of a load balancer), ONLY accept headers from trusted proxies (whitelist the load balancer\u0026rsquo;s IP addresses)\nImplementing account lockout based on username.\nUnusual logging and alerts: the same username being attempted from dozens of different IPs in a short period of time is a clear sign of credential stuffing/brute force.\nReferences # Challenge link: https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/521 Burp Intruder - Pitchfork Attack: https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/tools/intruder/configure-attack/attack-types ","date":"20/2/2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cyb3rhurr1c4n3-blog/write-ups/pico-ctf/crack-the-gate-2/","section":"","summary":"Bypass IP-based rate limiting via X-Forwarded-For spoofing to brute-force credentials without being blocked.","title":"Crack The Gate 2","type":"write-ups"},{"content":"","date":"20/2/2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cyb3rhurr1c4n3-blog/tags/picoctf/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Picoctf","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20/2/2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cyb3rhurr1c4n3-blog/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20/2/2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cyb3rhurr1c4n3-blog/tags/web-exploitation/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Web-Exploitation","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"20/2/2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cyb3rhurr1c4n3-blog/categories/write-ups/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Write-Ups","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cyb3rhurr1c4n3-blog/technical-blog/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"technical-blog"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cyb3rhurr1c4n3-blog/write-ups/hack-the-box/","section":"","summary":"","title":"","type":"write-ups"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cyb3rhurr1c4n3-blog/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/cyb3rhurr1c4n3-blog/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
